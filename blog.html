<p>Insurance is a risk-transferring mechanism that ensures full or partial financial compensation for the loss or damage caused by event(s) beyond the control of the insured party. And in turn, risk management is very important for the insurance industry. Insurers consider every available quantifiable factor to develop profiles of high and low insurance risk, which determines the insurance premiums. And this leads to higher premiums for higher the risk.</p>
<p>Today, data availability has greatly increased, and with this plethora of information at hand, insurers can evaluate risk of insurance policies at a much higher accuracy. Insurers collect a great deal of information about policy holders and insured objects, on which statistical methods and tools based can be used to analyze data or to determine insurance policy risk levels.</p>
<p>Risk management has many facets, and each of these have an avenue where data analytics and intelligence can solve problems and open new avenues for business success.</p>
